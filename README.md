# FYI
- Cypress automation script will be available at "cypress > integration".
- I used VS Code to write the cypress automation script. Just clone this repository in your machine, then go to the terminal and write "npx cypress open" command. Make sure you run the project locally on your machine before running the script.
- There will be two integration files.
- I added an excel sheet by providing some UI improvements named "Improvement suggestions.xlsx" in the cypress folder.
